# Omeka Backup Script
## Basic functionality
`backup.sh some-config.cfg`

Use the sample.cfg as a template, define the database, server directory, and save directory. Your backup will be under _backups, in the directory that you defined.

The script will run as the root user in MySQL, so have those credentials handy, or change the user in the script.
